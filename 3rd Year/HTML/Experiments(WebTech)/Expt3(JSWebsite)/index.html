            <h2>Wild Horizons</h2>
            <p>Saving nature is at the very heart of what we do as WWF. For 60 years, we have made it our mission to find solutions that save the marvelous array of life on our planet by applying the best science available and working closely with local communities. But our work is far from done. Humans are behind the current rate of species extinction, which is at least 100 to 1,000 times higher than nature intended. We've seen an average decline of 69% in species populations since 1970, according to WWF's Living Planet Report 2022. And the impacts will reach far beyond the potential cultural loss of iconic species like tigers, rhinos, and whales.<br><br></p>
            <p>The good news is we've also seen what's working. WWF has been part of successful wildlife recovery stories ranging from southern Africa's black rhino to black bucks in the Himalayas. And this, in turn, is helping to protect rich and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to benefit from nature. This much is clear: we cannot afford to fail in our mission to save a living planet.<br><br></p>
            <p>The millions of different species on our planet are essential for so many of the most important things in our lives. This complex web of life provides the natural systems we depend on â€“ from clean air and water to fertile soils and a stable climate. It gives us food, medicines and materials, and supports millions of jobs. And it also inspires us, making our lives richer in so many ways. But our planet's wildlife is in crisis, numbers have fallen by more than half since 1970, and species are becoming extinct at an alarming rate. We need to reverse this loss of nature and create a future where wildlife and people thrive again.<br><br></p>
            <p>Human activities threaten wildlife in two main ways: by destroying and damaging the places where wildlife lives, and by using them in ways that are unsustainable.  Vast areas of natural habitat continue to be lost to agriculture, urban sprawl, mining and infrastructure, or are suffering from the effects of pollution, introduced species that often out-compete native wildlife, and, increasingly, climate change. Meanwhile, many species are declining because of unsustainable levels of hunting, fishing and harvesting. Others are being driven toward extinction to support the international wildlife trade, or killed when they come into direct conflict with humans and livestock.<br><br></p>
